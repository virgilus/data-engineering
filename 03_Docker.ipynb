    "# Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying the development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## History of Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker was created by [Solomon Hykes](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Hykes), a French software engineer. It was initially developed as an internal project at dotCloud, a platform-as-a-service company. The first public release of Docker was in March 2013, and it quickly gained popularity due to its ability to simplify application deployment and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of ways to install Docker, but the most common and recommended way is to use Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop provides a user-friendly interface and integrates well with your operating system, making it easier to manage containers and images. Plus, it is available for all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the difference between Docker and a virtual machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker containers and virtual machines (VMs) are both used to run applications in isolated environments, but they differ significantly in how they achieve this isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Virtual Machines**: VMs run a full operating system on top of a hypervisor, which emulates hardware. Each VM includes a complete OS, libraries, and dependencies, making them heavier and slower to start compared to containers. VMs provide strong isolation since each VM runs its own OS, but they consume more resources and are less portable than containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Docker Containers**: Containers share the host operating systems kernel and isolate the application processes from each other. They are lightweight, start quickly, and use fewer resources because they do not require a full operating system for each instance. Containers are portable and can run consistently across different environments, making them ideal for microservices and cloud-native applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Develop with Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/develop-with-containers/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The command \"docker compose watch\" is used to automatically rebuild and restart containers when files change. This is useful during development to see changes in real-time without manually stopping and starting containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build and push your first image\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/build-and-push-first-image/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depending on your machine, it might be a bit difficult to authenticate with Docker Hub. Follow the instructions online.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images can be either public or private. Public images are accessible to anyone, while private images require authentication to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images can be built from a Dockerfile, which contains instructions on how to create the image, including the base image, dependencies, and commands to run. Or they can be pulled from a registry like Docker Hub, which hosts a vast collection of pre-built images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a container?\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do it twice, once using Docker Desktop and once using the command line. This will help you understand the differences in managing containers through the GUI versus the CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First application with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "How can I run a Python Script with docker? Let's try to create something very simple, like a Python script that prints \"Hello World\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**>>>** Create a new directory that contains a file called `app.py` with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**>>>** Then we're going to choose the OS that will run the script. Let's use the latest version of Ubuntu. We'll also need Python but, just to make sure everything will install smoothly, we'll first update our OS and then install Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file called `Dockerfile` in the same directory with the following content.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM ubuntu:latest\n",
    "RUN apt-get update\n",
    "RUN apt-get install -y python3\n",
    "WORKDIR /usr/src/app\n",
    "COPY app.py .\n",
    "CMD [\"python3\", \"app.py\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**>>>** Now make sure your working directory is the directory where the script and the Dockerfile are located and let's build the image using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker build -t hello-world .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**>>>** Let's make sure the image was created successfully by listing all images and look at the size of the image we just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker images\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**>>>** Now we can run the image we just created using the following command (you don't need to be in the same directory as the Dockerfile to run this command):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run hello-world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You should see \"Hello World\" printed in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**>>>** Now let's try to optimize the Dockerfile by using a smaller base image and simplifying the commands. We can use the `python:3.13.3-slim` image, which is a lightweight version of Python. Now we don't have to install Python separately, as it is already included in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.13.3-slim\n",
    "WORKDIR /usr/src/app\n",
    "COPY app.py .\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be faster to build and run the image now, as it uses a smaller base image and fewer commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**>>>** Finally let's get into the container and run the script from there. This is useful for debugging or running commands directly in the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -it hello-world /bin/bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a little walk inside the container and run the script again:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To leave just type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**: If we a had a requirement file with dependencies, we could copy it into the container and install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the Dockerfile. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.13.3-slim\n",
    "WORKDIR /usr/src/app\n",
    "COPY app.py .\n",
    "COPY requirements.txt .\n",
    "RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n",
